# PART A: HTML + CSS

This project uses Html + Css(Sass).

I choose to use Sass because it helps me by keeping the style sheets concise. It provides variables as a way to store information that I want to reuse throughout my style sheet. Also it donâ€™t repeat similar CSS statements Throughout the project
